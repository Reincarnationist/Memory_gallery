# Memory Gallery

A fully functional, clean website for sharing photos, it works like a lightweight social media app as you can comment/like others' photos.

Use React as frontend and Material-UI as main ui components.

Django/DRF is the backend part, filled with REST api design.

Aws S3 as storage and RDS-mysql as Database.

Supports User anthentication and original quality photo storage.


Problems encountered so far:

User authentication: JWT vs session
Storage
Front-end and back-end 
multiple upload
generate thumbnail
